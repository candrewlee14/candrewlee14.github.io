    I'm trying a different narrative style for this post. Forgive me if it feels strange, I'm experimenting!

It was a crisp, clear morning in Salt Lake City. Bookended by snowstorms, that milder week had been Utah's "fool's spring" I'm told. 
My dark blue fleece sweater was plenty warm for the weather. 
I was walking back towards the shopping mall, just having put the leftovers of my [Bruled French Toast](https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu/saturday-sunday-brunch/bruled-french-toast) from Cheesecake Factory in my car. 
It had been my first time trying the dish... a bit too sweet for my taste, but not so much that it wouldn't be worth enjoying the rest as a dessert later. 
As I walked, I glanced up to my right. The onlooking mountain range to the east was picturesque: the stark white of snow overlaid on the dark gray rock under the pale blue sky. I casually assumed that this would be my personal pinnacle panorama of the day. I was wrong.

What I thought was going to be an standard mall outing with the usual stops was nothing of the sort. That became abundantly clear when I walked past the Apple store opening their doors, unveiling their Vision Pro models for the first time that day. For some reason, even knowing there was an Apple store at this mall, it hadn't even crossed my mind that they might have the Vision Pro on public display. Like a cartoon cat floating towards the wafting scent of a good pie, I meandered into the store. 

With typical Apple flair, the futuristic goggles were presented front-and-center on a long white oak table. They were suspended horizontally, the way you'd wear them on your head, on a elevated metal wire stands matching the titanium-colored interior of the room.
On the same table were iPads displaying specs of the product and QR codes for scheduling a demo. I knew I had to try it out, so I scanned the code with my iPhone. A native UI dialog popped up, like connecting Airpods, verifying my Apple ID. Then it forwarded me to a website to pick available demo times. Being one of the first ones in the store that day, I was lucky enough to find a slot available just minutes later. I was in.

As a disclaimer, I've had very few VR experiences in my life. The only contact I can remember is when one of my roommates checked out a PS VR along with a couple games from the University of Utah library. We tried a few of the standard experiences along with a few games like Job Simulator, Resident Evil, and Beat Saber.

It was certainly cool, but I don't remember it really capturing me. This was 5 years ago on already 5-year old hardware, so obviously the technology wasn't where it is today. At the time though, it felt like a bit like a novelty product. The screen resolution was poor, the tracking was inaccurate, and many of the games felt gimmicky. I had a fun experience then, but it wasn't enough for me to go through the checkout/setup to do it again. And it certainly wasn't enough for me to be interested in buying one.
