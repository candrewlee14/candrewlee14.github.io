## Beginnings 

I've always been a tinkerer. Ever since I was little, I've been interested in how things work and how they're made. 
My favorite books were non-fictions about engines, light, electricity, and space!
A few boxes of Legos, Lincoln Logs, and an Erector Set gave me every opportunity to let my imagination loose.

I made toy cars, spaceships, ninja stars, skycrapers, boats, robots, and more. 
During school, I was constantly doodling my own cartoons. 
When I took piano lessons, I'd often make up my own songs rather than playing the music I was assigned, much to the dismay of my teachers.
Creation in any form was what made me happy, but *especially* when it involved science.

Around 6th grade, my teacher introduced the class to this cool education website called [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).
My mind was *completely* blown. All this time that school felt like it was moving too slowly, 
there was this vast library of free videos where I could learn almost anything at my own pace?!
I could ask all the questions in the world and nobody would tell me I'm asking too many questions?!

I ate it up. I learned about biology, calculus, chemistry, and statistics.
Salman Kahn's voice is probably permanently engrained in my psyche, and I thank him for it.
Then one day, I ran into a new learning module available called Computer Programming.

## Discovering Code

I had always thought computers were amazing, and I loved playing video games like NBA2K7 and Lego Star Wars on the PlayStation 2. 
I thought it'd be really cool to learn about how those all work, so I decided to dive in to Kahn Academy's coding course.
Suddenly, I was transported to a whole new world of creation. 
With only the family desktop computer running in front of me, I could build *anything*. 
I'd never run out of pieces, and I'd never be missing the right size of gear.
There were no limits, and the only parts I needed were bits of knowledge.

Of course, I started small. Kahn Academy taught a dialect of ProcessingJS, so I started learning about the event loop and how to draw simple shapes to the screen.
Then I started learning about making short animations, and then how to make simple games.
There was a small community competition going on to make a game under 150 lines of code, so I built a little game called [Jump](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/jump/2179273176). 
Reading the code now, I've got a *boatload* of advice to give 12-year-old me. 

Overlooking the terrific code quality, it was a pivotal experience for me.
I made a game that a hundred strangers decided to upvote! I didn't even know a hundred people! I showed the game to my family and they thought it was awesome.
With some hard work, I had made something that anybody with a computer could play and maybe even enjoy (and that still stands nearly a decade later). 
The thrill of building something that people will enjoy continues to drive me today.

Over the next few years, I'd learn to make simple websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). 
I learned some jQuery too, which I'd later return to and find completely out of style (*classic* frontend experience).
Everything I was working on was web-based and visual, right up until my very first high school Computer Science class. 

## High School & Beyond

In high school, I learned to use C++ and C# with Visual Studio. I built my first console applications, a choose-your-own adventure game and a file searcher. 
I learned to use WinForms and built a replica of the calculator app.
