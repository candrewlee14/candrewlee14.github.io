excerpt: What I've built.
---

It's difficult to unify my portfolio under one umbrella.
The truth is I've worked on many projects in a broad number of topics.
This early in my career, I've built most of my projects to explore the vast landscape of the software space.
Sometimes, the point of a project is to help me understand a programming language better and learn the tooling and ecosystem around it. 
Sometimes it's to automate a repetitive task. Sometimes it's to create something entertaining. Sometimes it's to help communicate a message. My projects will often have a prominent visual aspect, because an attractive, clean UI a much nicer experience both as a developer and a user. 

I've gone ahead and separated these projects into topics. Some fit into multiple buckets, so I just picked one for it. Without further ado, let's get into some of my projects!

## Simulations 
Simulations allow exploration of concepts. They can help students and researchers develop an intuitive understanding of a process.
Using the power of modern computing, we can visualize ideas and communicate beautiful complexity.

### - Evolution

Evolution is a difficult process to imagine. The effects of environmental pressures and competition isn't always easy to see in real life on our timescale.
Simulating evolution and keeping track of the data, however, makes that process easier to understand. 

I built this to help students understand how different traits can be advantageous through natural selection. You can watch how overpopulation can cause extinction, or how certain evolutionary tradeoffs are made over time.

### - Cellular Automata

<div class="txt-side">

https://github.com/candrewlee14/game-of-life-rs

I wrote this to explore [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
This is a cross-platform terminal application that takes mouse input. Choose a random seed, or leave the map empty and fill it in as you please. 
Press space to pause and resume, and watch cellular automata at work.

The incredible complexity that can be generated by simple rules is part of what makes universe so wonderful, 
and exploring of different behaviors of simple patterns in the Game of Life can be mesmerizing.

### - Boid Flocking

https://github.com/candrewlee14/boidflock

Boidflock is another example of artificial life, where complex behaviors observed in reality can be simulated with a simple set of rules.

The patterns look like flocks of birds or schools of fish moving together.
I've built this software to be easily tunable, so you can play with the weights of different rules to generate new behaviors.
It makes for a great screensaver!

## Games

### - Hangman
<div class="txt-and-img">
<div class="txt-side">

https://github.com/candrewlee14/hangman-rs

This is the classic hangman game, it generates a random word and the player has to guess the letters. 
I wanted to make something to be able to play on the terminal across platforms. 
It was one of my very first programs in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language, and it helped me become more familiar with working with packages.

### - Multiplayer Maze Game

<div class="txt-and-img">
<div class="txt-side">

https://github.com/candrewlee14/mazeio

I wanted to be able to race my younger brother in a maze game, so I decided to build it for us.
It was some of my very first work with networking, and I learned a lot. I built an async server using the [Tokio runtime](https://tokio.rs/),
and a fancy terminal UI client. There's structured logging, mock client testing, and performance benchmarking all in there.

### - AlphaBlitz

<div class="txt-side">

https://candrewlee14.github.io/alphablitz

During the Great Wordle Craze of early 2021, I was inspired to build my own word game for my family.
I called it AlphaBlitz.

You make words starting with letters from the daily 10-letter word. The goal of the game is to use all 26 letters of the alphabet.

I wrote it using Typescript and the Svelte web framework, which I highly recommend.
It's got an automated CI/CD pipeline, domain name, and everything :)

In my completely unbiased opinion, I happen to think that the game is pretty fun, so check it out!
