    I&#39;m writing here to document my experience with this technology, in case someday I have kids wondering what it was like when I first used an augmented reality headset.
    I&#39;ve never heard much about how using the first iPhone felt, but I&#39;m sure all the little interactions like touching and swiping that feel second-nature to us today must&#39;ve felt magical.
    Hopefully, I can communicate some of that magic newness here.
<p>With that being said, this won’t be an in-depth technical or objective review. This is about how I felt and what I think that means.
I’m trying a different narrative style for this post. Forgive me if it feels strange, I’m experimenting!</p>`,te,g,Ke=`It was a crisp, clear morning in Salt Lake City. Bookended by snowstorms, that milder week had been Utah’s “fool’s spring” I’m told.
My dark blue fleece sweater was plenty warm for the weather.
I was walking back towards the shopping mall, just having put the leftovers of my <a href="https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu/saturday-sunday-brunch/bruled-french-toast" rel="nofollow">Bruled French Toast</a> from Cheesecake Factory in my car.

A native UI dialog popped up, like connecting Airpods, verifying my Apple ID. Then it forwarded me to a website to pick available demo times.

As a disclaimer, I&#39;ve had very few VR experiences thus far in my life. The only contact I can remember is when one of my roommates checked out a PS VR along with a couple games from the University of Utah library. We tried some of the standard experiences along with a few games like Job Simulator, Resident Evil, and Beat Saber.
<p>It was certainly cool, but I don’t remember it really capturing me. This was roughly 5 years ago on already 5-year old hardware, so obviously the technology wasn’t where it is today. At the time though, it felt like a bit like a novelty product. The screen resolution was poor, the tracking was inaccurate, and many of the games felt gimmicky.</p> <p>I did had a fun experience, but it wasn’t enough for me to go through the checkout/setup to do it again. I wasn’t interested in buying one yet (not that I could even afford one at the time), and it <em>certainly</em> hadn’t sparked my confidence that <em>this</em> would be the future form factor of consumer technology.</p>`,se,I,$e="When my appointment came time, I was directed to sit at one of the empty tables. A young employee with a flashy smile walked out with a Vision Pro on a small custom wooden platter with an indent to seat the goggles. They explained the general structure of the ~20 minute demo, and showed me that what I’d see in the goggles would be what they’d see on their iPad. Next, I did a face scan, gently turning left, right, up, and down to map my face in 3D. Finally, it was time to put it on. I grabbed the gray-and-orange techno-knit band, pulled it over my head, put the mask over eyes, turned the dial to cinch the band snug, pressed down the button above my right eyebrow, and then we were underway.",re,T,Ge="The experience started in a completely dark environment, no passthrough. The iconic white Apple logo phased in directly ahead, then faded out. Colorful dots around the circumference of a circle appeared, and the instructor told me that this would calibrate the device.

Intuitively, I looked at the rainbow Photos icon and tapped my fingers together. A flat window opened up in the air, showing a grid of curated photos.

The photo was nice, but nothing novel.",pe,H,it="Next, I was told I could pinch and swipe to go to the next photo, like pulling a string.

That video was apparently filmed with an iPhone 15 Pro. That is a huge deal in my opinion, because it seems kinda dystopian to be filming such a precious simple moment while wearing a big VR headset.
<p>Because watching events live through a titanium brick in our hands <em>is</em> currently acceptable (though I’m sure that once would’ve been more contentious), that opens the door to separating the means of memory capture vs. memory replay.</p> <p>Maybe soon it won’t be cringy to bring a 360 degree sphere camera to an event, then in the privacy of your home, you’d be able to re-live that experience without judgement.
Of course, this is all operating under the assumption that wearing a headset around people will remain dystopian.</p> <p>It seems like there are a couple possible pathways here:</p> <p>1: The form factor improves, potentially down to something like <a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/electronics/RW4006ray-ban%20%7C%20meta%20wayfarer-black/8056597988384" rel="nofollow">Meta’s Raybans</a>. If we are going to require a battery cord like the Vision Pro, why not move the compute off your head too? Something about cyber sunglasses feels less offensive than a chunky headset somehow. A major technical challenge either way.</p> <p><strong>OR</strong> 2: The form factor remains the same, limited by price or compute:</p> <ul><li><p>Wearing AR headsets in public remains <em>super</em> cringe. What happens to VR/AR?</p> <ul><li><p>VR/AR continues to improve, but doesn’t work on-the-go. It gets used for certain kinds of work, education &amp; training, entertainment, etc. and can replay the memories captured on smartphones’ improved cameras.</p> <p>Seeing someone playing a Nintendo Switch on the Subway probably elicits more cringe than a smartphone, but at home, that’s perfectly acceptable. VR/AR would remain like desktop computers or gaming consoles.</p></li> <li><p><strong>OR</strong> VR/AR dies. It doesn’t bring in enough revenue to keep investing in it over 2D experiences.</p></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>OR</strong> The cringe associated with the current headset form factor dissolves. I’m sure people once thought staring and prodding at a little techno-box in public was taboo, but here we are now… everyone’s doing it. Hard to imagine right now, but possible.</p></li></ul> <p>No matter what happens, when I’m 80 years old, I think I’d probably be willing to pay an enormous price to be able to re-live some of the happiest moments of my life. Whether it’s socially encouraged or not, if I was able to capture some of those moments when they happened, I’d want to experience them again in the highest fidelity experience possible.</p> <p>My first VR experience didn’t make me feel this way, but Apple’s Vision Pro has crossed some threshold for me… I can see a future where this technology has an important place in life. Not as a novelty or a gimmick, but as a vehicle for realistic experiences.</p>`,fe,P,lt=`The next couple pieces of the demo were short and sweet. I tried out browsing on Safari, again pulling an invisible string to scroll <em>or</em> reaching out to touch-scroll on the virtual window. All the standard web interactions necessary to browse the internet seemed in place, including a pop-up keyboard.
Then I opened up a Slides presentation, where a 3D model of a bridge popped out of the display and could be rotated and zoomed.

You have the choice between chicken-pecking with your index fingers or looking at each individual key and pinching, and neither method feels fast. I’d love to know the record WPM for typing like this. I wonder if a new input method like Meta’s <a href="https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2021/3/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform/" rel="nofollow">wristband neural interface</a>, paired with great software and some practice, will bridge this gap.</p> <p>Safari is also still just a 2D monitor-like experience, which doesn’t feel like enough of a quality improvement to justify the ecosystem moving pains and pricetag.
Obviously it takes time for software to adapt to new technology, especially if the new frontier is an expensive &amp; unsure bet, so I’ll have some patience here and settle for compatibility without elevation on that front.</p>`,ge,R,ht="The final two portions of the demo frankly blew my socks off.",ve,j,mt=`The guide told me it was time for <em>Environments</em>. Using my eyes as the cursor, I clicked on the “Environments” tab on the left side of the app menu view.
A menu with a list of beautiful and interesting places opened. My first stop: Haleakalā. The scene was only translucently overlaid on reality.
I could change the immersion level by twisting the crown dial, and as I did so, reality faded away, leaving only a few ghostly outlines of the store-goers around me.`,be,V,dt=`That beautiful orange sunrise at the top of the Hawaiian volcano plucked a heartstring for me in that moment.
When I was a teenager, I visited Maui with my family and we decided to make the trek to Haleakalā. To make it to the top by sunrise, you have to wake up at <em>3 in the morning</em>.
With groggy faces and a few grumpy attitudes (me), the family piled into the car in the middle of the night.
As we drove up the mountainside, I remember it pouring rain and the wind pounding against the minivan.
We hoped and prayed that the storm would break by the time we reached the peak, but luck wasn’t with us that day…`,ke,W,pt=`All I remember from when we reached the parking lot at the top was total chaos. We were blanketed in a thick, dark fog. The wind was howling, and parents were holding onto the younger kids to not let them blow off the cliffsides.
My dad’s hat blew off his head and we all scrambled to gather it back up before it was lost forever. We yelled out to each other in the mist, “did we miss it?”
And we waited atop the mountain, storm still raging, until it was abundantly clear that the sun had risen and we didn’t get to see it.`,xe,S,ut=`That vivid decade-old memory sprung back into my head the instant I saw that pink tops of those clouds, and I couldn’t help but think <em>“this is what I should’ve seen”!</em>

If a picture is worth a thousand words, the AR/VR experience of that place is worth at least a thousand pictures.</p> <p>Of course, I can’t speak to the ratio of VR to reality in this <em>specific</em> case, since I only remember dark clouds and immense tiredness.
So I guess in this instance, VR <em>beat</em> reality from my limited perspective.</p>`,Ce,q,wt=`It was time to pick another environment, and going to the moon was the obvious answer for me.
A glance, a tap, and suddenly my surroundings became light gray lunar rock all the way into the horizon and pitch-black space above.
As I looked around, high up and behind my head was Earth. It looked small, not much bigger than a basketball in my field-of-view. Swirling white clouds, brown-green landmasses, and deep blue oceans. Carl Sagan’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" rel="nofollow">Pale Blue Dot</a> speech came to mind.

Again, my reality faded out and a new set of surroundings phased in. I was in a beatiful music studio, warm-toned wood paneling on the walls, a shiny black grand piano ahead. Alicia Keys was singing into a microphone just a few feet in front of me. Sporting two squiggly bubble braids, she wore oversized rose-colored glasses and a bright red bomber jacket over a white shirt and jeans. Band members were playing music all around the room. Keys was looking straight at me, and it felt unsettlingly intimate… like the feeling of <em>strangers</em> at a party singing Happy Birthday to you as you sit awkwardly smiling (and it’s not even your birthday). Immaculate vibes despite the discomfort.`,Ae,O,bt="Almost as soon as it started, I was teleported to the next scene. I was now on a grassy green soccer field with a club team of young African boys laughing and dribbling a ball. Next, I was in a stone courtyard with several men doing what appeared to be a traditional Turkish whirling dance, wearing white dresses billowing in a circle as they spun. Then I was back in Africa, watching a group of gray rhinos run around in front of me on rust-colored dirt.

When they were walking right-to-left in my vision then turned to face me, the fourth-wall illusion in my brian shattered.
As they got closer, my heart started beating faster and when they got within arms reach, my flight-or-fight response kicked in.
<em>“Woah woah woah, that’s too close, big fella.”</em></p> <p>The instructor told me that was one of their favorite parts too, and that most people react how I did.
It’s impressive how fully your mind just accepts this new reality, and every reflex continues to be on high alert.</p> <p>You’ve probably seen plenty of videos of people wearing VR headsets accidentally punching their TVs, or terrified to take a step in any direction in <em>their living room</em> because they <em>feel</em> like they’re walking on a plank on the edge of a towering skyscraper. So obviously this effect isn’t new to the Apple Vision Pro specifically.</p> <p>Either way, the level of immersion possible here makes me excited for the future of entertainment.
I think there are two important keys that would make this competitive with existing entertainment media:</p> <ul><li><p>If they can find a way to make this a shared experience, where multiple people in a room can be seeing the same surrounding movie <em>and</em> see each other, they’re gonna have something really special on their hands.</p></li> <li><p>They <em>need</em> high-quality content. As streaming services already know, content is king. If VR can pull enough of a consumer base to attract studios to make great shows whose storytelling stands on its own two feet without leaning too heavily on the novelty of 3D content… that could have a collosal impact on the entertainment industry. And it’s gotta be 3D-exclusive (not just 2D with some depth) if they want to beat out existing media formats. It’s a chicken-and-egg problem, however.</p> <p>If entertainment is to be the primary motivator for purchasing VR equipment, then VR will require quality native content, but at the same time, studios will demand a large VR userbase to bet on 3D-exclusive content. Who will be the first mover? Will VR companies like Apple fund new 3D content with heavy up-front losses to jumpstart VR adoption themselves? When will studios with no skin in the game for VR make that transition, if ever? Only time will tell.</p></li></ul> <p>I doubt this will format will replace traditional movie &amp; TV anytime soon, but I definitely see a path where this becomes a very powerful new way to consume media. Personally, I get a bit giddy imagining a Star Wars experience of sitting in a bustling cantina filled with alien life, then walking out to my hulking metal ship, firing up the hyperdrive, and traveling to a new exotic planet at warp speed. I’ll be keeping my fingers crossed. 🤞</p>`,Re,F,It="The demo soon ended, and I lifted the headset off of my face and handed it to the guide.
