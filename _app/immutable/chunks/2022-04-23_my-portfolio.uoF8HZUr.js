The truth is I‚Äôve worked on many projects in a broad number of topics.
This early in my career, I‚Äôve built most of my projects to explore the vast landscape of the software space.
Sometimes, the point of a project is to help me understand a programming language better and learn the tooling and ecosystem around it.
Sometimes it‚Äôs to automate a repetitive task. Sometimes it‚Äôs to create something entertaining. Sometimes it‚Äôs to help communicate a message. My projects will often have a prominent visual aspect, because an attractive, clean UI a much nicer experience both as a developer and a user.</p> <p>I‚Äôve gone ahead and separated these projects into topics. Some fit into multiple buckets, so I just picked one for each. Without further ado, let‚Äôs get into some of my projects!</p> <h2>Simulations</h2> <blockquote><p>Simulations allow exploration of concepts. They can help students and researchers develop an intuitive understanding of a process.
Using the power of modern computing, we can visualize ideas and communicate beautiful complexity.</p></blockquote> <h3>- <a href="https://github.com/candrewlee14/EvolutionGameP5/" rel="nofollow">Evolution</a></h3> <div class="txt-and-img"><div class="txt-side"><p>Evolution is a difficult process to imagine. The effects of environmental pressures and competition isn‚Äôt always easy to see in real life on our timescale.
Simulating evolution and keeping track of the data, however, makes that process easier to understand.</p> <p>I built this to help students understand how different traits can be advantageous through natural selection. You can watch how overpopulation can cause extinction, or how certain evolutionary tradeoffs are made over time.</p></div> <div class="img-side"><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="/my-portfolio/evolutionSim.png"> <img src="/my-portfolio/evolutionSim.png" alt="evolution simulator" width="400"></picture> <picture><source type="image/png" srcset="/my-portfolio/evolutionSimGraph.png"> <img src="/my-portfolio/evolutionSimGraph.png" alt="evolution simulator graph" width="400"></picture></div></div> <h3>- <a href="https://github.com/candrewlee14/game-of-life-rs" rel="nofollow">Cellular Automata</a></h3> <div class="txt-and-img"><div class="txt-side"><p>I wrote this to explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" rel="nofollow">Conway‚Äôs Game of Life</a>.
This is a cross-platform terminal application that takes mouse input. Choose a random seed, or leave the map empty and fill it in as you please.
Press space to pause and resume, and watch cellular automata at work.</p> <p>The incredible complexity that can be generated by simple rules is part of what makes universe so wonderful,
and exploring of different behaviors of simple patterns in the Game of Life can be mesmerizing.</p></div> <div class="img-side"><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="/my-portfolio/gameOfLife.png"> <img src="/my-portfolio/gameOfLife.png" style="float: right;" alt="game of life" width="400"></picture></div></div> <h3>- <a href="https://github.com/candrewlee14/boidflock" rel="nofollow">Boid Flocking</a></h3> <div class="txt-and-img"><div class="txt-side"><p>Boidflock is another example of artificial life, where complex behaviors observed in reality can be simulated with a simple set of rules.</p> <p>The patterns look like flocks of birds or schools of fish moving together.
I‚Äôve built this software to be easily tunable, so you can play with the weights of different rules to generate new behaviors.
It makes for a great screensaver!</p></div> <div class="img-side"><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="/my-portfolio/boidFlock.png"> <img src="/my-portfolio/boidFlock.png" alt="boid flocking" style="float: right;" width="400"></picture></div></div> <h2>Games</h2> <blockquote><p>We love to play. Games bring us together, inspire friendships, and bring joy to people everywhere.
Games, in many ways, are a universal language.

It was some of my very first work with networking, and I learned a lot. I built an async server using the <a href="https://tokio.rs/" rel="nofollow">Tokio runtime</a>,

I called it AlphaBlitz.</p> <p>You make words starting with letters from the daily 10-letter word. The goal of the game is to use all 26 letters of the alphabet.</p> <p>I wrote it using Typescript and the Svelte web framework, which I highly recommend.
It‚Äôs got an automated CI/CD pipeline, domain name, and everything :)</p> <p>In my completely unbiased opinion, I happen to think that the game is pretty fun, so check it out!</p></div> <div class="img-side"><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="/my-portfolio/alphaBlitz.png"> <img src="/my-portfolio/alphaBlitz.png" alt="alphablitz game" width="300"></picture></div></div> <h2>Web Dev</h2> <blockquote><p>Web development allows one to communcate a message to the whole world.

Languages make opinionated tradeoffs in their design decisions, address the faults of predecessors,

Lox is a dynamic, high-level scripting language.</p> <p>Golox lexes, parses, and interprets Lox programs. It implements a pretty REPL to interactively run lines of code. Helpful parsing errors and runtime errors are reported.
Golox leverages Go‚Äôs garbage collector to efficiently handle memory.</p> <p>Benchmarking results in faster runtimes than Python in many cases, although recursion is currently slower.
I‚Äôve got more work I‚Äôm planning on doing with this, like adding classes and possibly lowering to LLVM‚Äôs IR for compilation.</p></div> <div class="img-side"><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="/my-portfolio/golox.png"> <img src="/my-portfolio/golox.png" alt="golox example run" width="300"></picture></div></div> <h3>- <a href="https://github.com/candrewlee14/zlog" rel="nofollow">Zlog</a></h3> <div class="txt-and-img"><div class="txt-side"><p>Zig is a powerful new systems language addressing the pitfalls of C & C++.
A language is only as strong as it‚Äôs ecosystem, so I wanted to contribute to Zig and it‚Äôs community.</p> <p>In addition to improving Zig‚Äôs standard library, I built a allocation-free logging library.
Logs are written in JSON or pretty printed to the terminal.
